<p text-align: justify;> Salutations, I'm Deana, a proud Merbok inhabitant and committed student at UITM right now. In the family dynamic, I am the second child out of four siblings, and I distinctly play the role of the only daughter. The lack of a father figure has characterized my journey; this situation started when I was just 9 years old. Even if there have been difficulties along the way, I approach life with a strong sense of resolve and a dedication to finding comfort in the quest of pleasure.

My academic endeavors at UITM provide me direction and purpose, and they are a central focus in my life. Beyond academia, I find happiness in the simplicity of life's pleasures, and I recognize the importance of embracing optimism in the midst of life's complications. In the face of adversity, I have developed resilience and an unyielding drive to enjoy the bounty of life. May this journey be a tribute to perseverance, thankfulness, and an unwavering commitment to extracting joy from life's many events.<p>
